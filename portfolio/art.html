				The goal of this assignment was to make a piece of art using a medium we were not comfortable or familiar with. Used to using pencil, I decided to try and make art out of left over cardboard I had laying around the house. I decided to make a POW block from <span class="italics">Super Mario Brothers 2</span>.

			<p class="wide3">
				This assignment was called Random Acts of Vandalism because we were told to "vandalize" campus with our  art. This meant to create art pieces around campus that were temporary, removable, and non-destructive. The "vandalism" aspect was simply that they were put in public spaces. Looking at the panels for sound absorbtion in one of the classrooms, I was reminded of a beehive and decided to tape up a drawing of a bee.

				This assignment was about picking and mixing things from different sources. I rather enjoy video games, so I decided to combine two of my favorites at the time: Paper Mario and Dead by Daylight. I took my favorite killer from Dead by Daylight, the Deathslinger, and drew him in the style of Paper Mario.
